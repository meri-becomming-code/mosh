# Contributing to MCC Accessibility Toolkit

Thank you for your interest in making education more accessible! We value all contributions, from code fixes to documentation updates.

## Values
*   **Accessibility First**: Every feature must output WCAG 2.1 AA compliant content.
*   **Open & Free**: This project uses the GPLv3 license. It must remain free for everyone.
*   **User Friendly**: Our users are often non-technical educators. Keep the GUI simple.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the project.
2.  **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
3.  **Make Changes**: Write clean, commented code.
4.  **Test**: Ensure the GUI still launches and the Fixer script runs on sample files.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Describe what you changed and why.

## Areas for Improvement
*   Better Math/LaTeX detection in HTML.
*   Improved contrast analysis algorithms.
*   More robust PDF table extraction.
*   Localization/Translation support.

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and constructive. We are here to help students.
