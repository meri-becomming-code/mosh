# MOSH ADA Toolkit: Grant / Release Time Proposal

## Executive Summary
**Project:** MOSH (Making Online Spaces Helpful) ADA Toolkit  
**Developer:** Meredith Kasprak (Faculty)  
**Objective:** Secure release time or grant funding to maintain and enhance the MOSH Toolkit, a faculty-developed open-source software solution that automates ADA compliance for Canvas courses.

## The Challenge
**The Mandate:** The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Final Rule on Title II of the ADA (signed April 2024) mandates that all public institutions' web content must meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards by **April 24, 2026**. Failure to comply risks federal civil rights lawsuits.  
**The Workload:** 
- Manual remediation of a single course takes **30-60 hours**.
- Faculty lack the technical skills to fix HTML code, complex PDFs, and mathematical notation.
- Commercial solutions (e.g., Equidox, Mathpix) are prohibitively expensive ($10k-$50k/year) and often require per-user licenses.

## The Solution: MOSH ADA Toolkit
**What it is:** A custom-built desktop application that integrates directly with Canvas exports (.imscc) to automatically fix accessibility issues.  
**Current Status:** Fully functional Version 1.0 (Release Candidate 16).
**Key Capabilities:**
- **Automated Remediation:** Instantly fixes heading structures, contrast issues, and table headers.
- **Math & Science Support:** Converts complex handwritten math PDF/images into accessible Canvas LaTeX (saving hours of typing).
- **Bulk Processing:** Handles entire courses at once, not just single files.
- **Faculty Workflow:** Designed by faculty, for faculty. No coding required.

## The Value Proposition (ROI)
**Cost of Inaction:**
- Legal risk (ADA lawsuits).
- Student attrition (inaccessible content).
- Massive faculty burnout from manual remediation mandates.

**Cost of Commercial Software:**
- **Equidox:** ~$15,000/year (base) + training.
- **Mathpix:** ~$5/user/month (adds up quickly for STEM departments).
- **Consultants:** ~$50-$100/hour for manual remediation.

**Cost of MOSH + Release Time:**
- **Software:** FREE (Open Source).
- **Maintenance Cost:** **1 Course Release per Semester** (approx. 20% of one faculty FTE).
- **Return on Investment:** If MOSH saves just **10 faculty members 20 hours each**, the release time pays for itself immediately (200 hours of skilled labor saved).

## The Proposal: Sustainable Maintenance & Training
Software is not a "one and done" product. It requires:
1.  **Maintenance:** Updates for Windows/Mac OS changes and Canvas API updates.
2.  **Support:** Troubleshooting for faculty users.
3.  **Enhancement:** Adding new features (e.g., deeper AI integration, Quiz support).
4.  **Training:** Leading workshops on how to use the toolkit effectively.

**The Ask:**
I propose a **[Insert Amount] Grant** OR **[X] Credit Hours of Release Time per Semester** to serve as the **"Accessible Technology Lead Developer"**. 

**Deliverables:**
- Maintain code stability and security.
- Distribution of updated versions (Windows & Mac).
- Conduct [X] training workshops per semester.
- Provide "Tier 2" support for complex remediation cases.
- Keep the software **Free and Open Source** for our institution and the broader education community.

## Conclusion
The MOSH Toolkit transforms an overwhelming mandate into a manageable task. By investing in its maintenance through release time, the institution signals a commitment to both accessibility and faculty support—achieving compliance efficiently and cost-effectively.
