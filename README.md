MOSH is a powerful, educator-focused suite designed to automate the heavy lifting of accessibility remediation for Canvas and Web content.

## 🎁 A Gift from One Educator to Another
MOSH wasn't born from a business plan or a commercial ambition. It began as a simple attempt to solve a personal struggle in my own classroom. I never intended to create this toolkit; I was simply looking for a way forward. 

One step at a time, and one insight at a time, the path was revealed to me. I believe that my ability to build this was a gift from God, and I give Him all the glory for every insight granted during this journey. As a Christian, I believe that because I have been blessed with the ability to help, I have a sacred responsibility to share that help freely. I'm not here to hold a tool hostage for money; I'm here to serve.

We believe that accessibility is a foundational human right, not a profit center. Accessibility remediation shouldn't be a source of resentment or unpaid labor—it should be a seamless part of the teaching craft. This toolkit is a gift, freely given, to help you reclaim your time, protect your course quality, and focus on what truly matters: your students.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🛠️ Connect & Setup**: A unified command center to manage your Canvas tokens, AI keys, and project files in one place.
- **🎨 Canvas Remediation**: A complete suite for auditing and fixing accessibility issues in your course. Includes:
    - **✨ Auto-Fix**: Instantly corrects structural issues like headers and tables.
    - **📖 Guided Review**: A human-centric interface to write Alt Text and fix links page-by-page.
- **📐 Math Converter**: Uses "MOSH Magic" (AI) to read handwritten math and PDF equations, converting them into accessible LaTeX.
- **📄 File Conversion**: Instantly converts Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files into clean, accessible HTML.

## 💛 Dedication
This software is dedicated to my son, **Michael Joshua (MOSH) Albright**, who battles Diabetic Retinopathy. Having spent years in blindness and reclaiming his sight, his journey reminds us that accessibility isn't just a requirement; it's a lifeline.
