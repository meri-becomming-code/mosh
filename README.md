# MOSH Faculty ADA Toolkit

**"Making Online Spaces Helpful"**

## Dedication
This software is dedicated to my son, Michael Joshua (Mosh) Albright, who deals with diabetic retinopathy and spent three years blind, and to all the other students struggling with their own challenges. Accessibility isn't just a requirement; it's a lifeline.

## About
MOSH is a streamlined tool designed for faculty to audited and remediate accessibility issues in Canvas HTML content. It provides:
- **Auto-Fixing**: Structural fixes for headings, tables, and contrast.
- **Guided Review**: A human-in-the-loop interface for writing meaningful Alt Text and verifying links.
- **Conversion**: Smart conversion for Word, PPT, and PDF files into accessible HTML.
