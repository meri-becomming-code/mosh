### INTRO (0:00 - 0:30) - THE HOOK
**VISUAL:** You on camera, your workspace/home office  
**TONE:** Friendly, conversational, empathetic

**SCRIPT:**
> "Hey educators! I'm Dr. Meri Kasprak. I have a PhD in Instructional Design for online learning and a background in MIS and IT. Like many of you, I was looking at the April 2026 ADA deadline and feeling the stress. I had 15 years of Canvas content, hundreds of pages, thousands of images... and NO idea where to start.
> 
> So I used my background in tech and design to build a free tool that does 80% of the work automatically. And today I'm going to show you EXACTLY how to use it - in about 10 minutes of your time.
>
> Whether you teach elementary, high school, or college - this works. And yes, it's completely free. Let's do this!"

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
- "April 2026 Deadline ⏰"
- "100% Free Tool"

### PART 1: EXPORT FROM CANVAS (0:30 - 1:10)
**VISUAL:** Screen recording of Canvas  
**TONE:** Step-by-step, calm, reassuring

**SCRIPT:**
> "First, we need to get your Canvas course out so the toolkit can fix it. It's easier than you think.
>
> Log into Canvas... go to your course... click Settings in the left menu... scroll down and click 'Export Course Content'... make sure 'Export Course Content' is selected... and click 'Create Export'.
>
> Canvas is going to prepare your file - this takes about 2-5 minutes depending on how big your course is. You'll get an email when it's ready.
>
> *[Show email notification]*
>
> See? Got the email. Now click back to that Export tab, and here's your download. Click 'Download' and save it somewhere you'll remember - like your Desktop. This is your .imscc file - basically a backup of your whole course."

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
- "Settings → Export Course Content"
- "Wait for email (~2-5 min)"
- "Download .imscc file"

**CALLOUT BOXES:**
- "💡 TIP: This doesn't change your live course - it's just a copy!"

### PART 2: FIX WITH TOOLKIT (1:10 - 2:20)
**VISUAL:** Screen recording of MOSH Toolkit  
**TONE:** Excited, showing the magic happening

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now here's where it gets fun. Open up the MOSH ADA Toolkit.
>
> *[Show toolkit opening]*
>
> If this is your first time, definitely click this 'First Time? Start Here!' button - it walks you through everything. But let me show you the actual workflow.
>
> Step 1: Click 'Select .imscc File' and find that file we just downloaded from Canvas. Got it.
>
> Step 2: Click 'Auto-Fix Issues'. The toolkit is now scanning your entire course for accessibility problems and fixing what it can... 
>
> *[Show progress bar, activity log populating]*
>
> ...and DONE! Look at this - it fixed 87 issues automatically: headings, table structures, color contrast, font sizes. This is stuff that would have taken me HOURS to do manually.
>
> Step 3: Now we handle the stuff that needs a human - mostly image descriptions. Click 'Guided Review'.
>
> *[Show guided review interface]*
>
> See? It shows you each image one at a time and asks you to describe it. This is 'alt text' - it helps blind students know what's in the picture.
>
> For this bar graph, I'll type: 'Bar graph showing test scores improved from 70% to 95% after tutoring program.'
>
> Next image... this is my class photo. I'll write: 'Mrs. Kasprak's 3rd period class, Spring 2025.'
>
> You get the idea. The toolkit walks you through each one. No skipping, no forgetting. When you're done - you're done."

**SCRIPT:**

>
> The toolkit created a new .imscc file with all the fixes. Before you upload to your REAL course, create a test course first - just to be safe.
>
> *[Show creating new course in Canvas]*
>
> I'm calling mine 'Test - Bio 101 ADA'. Now go to Settings... Import Course Content... choose 'Canvas Course Export (.imscc)'... select that file... and Import.
>
> *[Show import process]*
>
> Canvas is importing... and done! Let's open a page and check it out.
>
> *[Show fixed page]*
>
> Look at that! Proper headings, my images all have descriptions, tables are accessible. This is beautiful. And it took... *[looks at watch]* ...about 10 minutes total. Most of that was waiting for Canvas.
