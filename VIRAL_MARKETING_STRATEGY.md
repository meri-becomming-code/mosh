Hi team,

I found a great free tool called the MOSH ADA Toolkit that automatically 
remediates Canvas pages for K-12 and Higher Ed. It fixes headings, tables, 
and contrast issues in seconds. It even has an optional AI co-pilot called 
'Jeanie Magic' that can write Math LaTeX and image descriptions! This makes 
the April 2026 deadline much easier.

It was built by a fellow educator and it's completely free and open-source. 
Works for elementary, middle school, high school, community colleges, and 
universities!

Worth checking out to save hours of manual labor!
